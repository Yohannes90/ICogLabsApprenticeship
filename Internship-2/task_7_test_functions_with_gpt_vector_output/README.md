### Task 7: Testing Conceptual Blending and Info-Theoretic Functions

#### Overview
This task involves testing the functionality of the `conceptual_blending` with `info-theoretic1` modules by importing them into a new file and running real outputs of the `gpt_vector` function. The goal is to ensure that the blending functions, such as `mu-emergence` and `mu-hqblend`, are working properly and generating expected results.

#### Code

```MeTTa
(import! &self conceptual_blending)
(import! &self info-theoretic1)


! (let*(
    ($concepts (gpt_vector "Spider" "Man"))
    ($concept1 (car-atom $concepts))
    ($wrapped-concept2 (cdr-atom $concepts))
    ($concept2 (car-atom $wrapped-concept2))
    ($degree (property-degree $concept1))
    ($max (property-max $concept1 $concept2))
    ($calculated-mu-emergence (mu-emergence $degree $max))
    ($min (property-min $concept1 $concept2))
    ($calculated-mu-hqblend (mu-hqblend $calculated-mu-emergence $min))
    )
    ($calculated-mu-hqblend $concept1 $concept2)
)

; Expected Output
; [(0.03182937256098939
;    (Concept Spider@Man (Property (legs 1.0) (intelligence 0.2) (web-creation 1.0) (strength 0.3) (symbolism 0.7) (agility 0.6) (predatory-behavior 1.0) (social-structure 0.1)))
;    (Concept Man@Spider (Property (legs 0.1) (intelligence 1.0) (web-creation 0.0) (strength 0.8) (symbolism 0.5) (agility 0.7) (predatory-behavior 0.2) (social-structure 0.9))))]

```

#### Key Features

- **Imports and Testing**: The `conceptual_blending` and `info-theoretic1` modules are imported and tested to ensure the blending functions operate correctly.
- **Real Outputs**: The output of the `gpt_vector` function for concepts "Spider" and "Man" is processed, and the results of `mu-emergence` and `mu-hqblend` are calculated and tested.
- **Output Validation**: The result of the blending functions is validated by checking if the expected outputs match the real-world data produced by the functions.
