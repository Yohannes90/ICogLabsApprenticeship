## 1. Introduction to Neo4j

Neo4j is a native graph database designed to store, manage, and query connected data. It excels at representing relationships between data points, making it ideal for various use cases like social networks, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.

### Benefits of using Neo4j

- **Intuitive Data Modeling**: Represents complex relationships naturally using nodes and edges.
- **Fast Performance**: Delivers efficient queries on connected data sets.
- **Scalability**: Scales horizontally to handle large and growing data volumes.
- **Flexibility**: Supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions and integrates with various programming languages.

## 2. Core Concepts

- **Nodes**: Represent entities in the graph, like people, products, or locations.
- **Relationships (Edges)**: Connect nodes and define the nature of the connection (e.g., "plays for", "friends with").
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with nodes and relationships, providing additional information (e.g., name, age, salary).
- **Labels**: Categorize nodes for easier organization and querying (e.g., "Player", "Team").

### RDBMS Vs Graph Database

Following is the table which compares Relational databases and Graph databases:

| **Sr.No** | **RDBMS**              | **Graph Database**        |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1         | Tables                 | Graphs                   |
| 2         | Rows                   | Nodes                    |
| 3         | Columns and Data       | Properties and its values|
| 4         | Constraints            | Relationships            |
| 5         | Joins                  | Traversal                |

## 3. Cypher Query Language

Cypher is a declarative query language designed specifically for Neo4j. It allows developers to create, read, update, and delete data in the graph.

### 3.1 CRUD Operations

#### Create

- **Nodes**: `CREATE (n:Label {property1: value1, property2: value2})`
- **Relationships**: `CREATE (n1:Label1) -[:RelationshipType]-> (n2:Label2)`

#### Read

- **All Nodes**: `MATCH (n) RETURN n`
- **Nodes with Specific Label**: `MATCH (n:Label) RETURN n`
- **Relationships**: `MATCH (n1)-[:RelationshipType]->(n2) RETURN n1, n2`

#### Update

- **Node Properties**: `MATCH (n) WHERE ID(n) = nodeId SET n.property = newValue`
- **Relationship Properties**: `MATCH (n1)-[r:RelationshipType]->(n2) SET r.property = newValue`

#### Delete

- **Node**: `MATCH (n) WHERE ID(n) = nodeId DETACH DELETE n`
- **Relationship**: `MATCH (n1)-[r]->(n2) DELETE r`

### 3.2 Filtering and Aggregation

#### Filtering

- **WHERE Clause**: Filters results based on node or relationship properties.
  ```cypher
  MATCH (n:Person {age > 30}) RETURN n
  ```
- **Predicates**: Utilize predicates like `EXISTS`, `ALL`, and `ANY` for complex filtering.
  ```cypher
  MATCH (p:Person)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(q) WHERE EXISTS(q.city) RETURN p
  ```

#### Aggregation

- **Aggregation Functions**: Summarize data sets using functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.
  ```cypher
  MATCH (p:Person) RETURN COUNT(p)
  MATCH (p:Product)-[:PURCHASED]->(u:User) RETURN AVG(p.price)
  ```
- **GROUP BY**: Group nodes based on properties and perform aggregations within each group.
  ```cypher
  MATCH (p:Product)
  GROUP BY p.category
  RETURN p.category, COUNT(p)
  ```

## 4. Example: Building a Player-Team Network

### 4.1 Data Model

- **Nodes**:
  - `Player` (properties: name, age, height)
  - `Team` (properties: name)
- **Relationships**:
  - `PLAYS_FOR` (Player) -> (Team) (property: salary)

### 4.2 Sample Cypher Queries

#### Create Nodes and Relationships

```cypher
CREATE (russell:PLAYER {name:"Russell Westbrook", age: 33, height: 1.91})
CREATE (lakers:TEAM {name:"LA Lakers"})
CREATE (russell) - [:PLAYS_FOR {salary: 33000000}] -> (lakers)
```

#### Query Players for a Specific Team

```cypher
MATCH (player:PLAYER) - [:PLAYS_FOR] -> (team:TEAM {name: "LA Lakers"})
RETURN player
```

## 5. Basic Operations with Nodes

This section demonstrates fundamental operations for creating nodes, labels, and properties, and returning results.

### 5.1 Create a Single Node

```cypher
CREATE (n:Person {name: "Alice", age: 30})
RETURN n
```

### 5.2 Create Multiple Nodes

```cypher
CREATE (p1:Person {name: "Bob", age: 25}),
       (p2:Person {name: "Charlie", age: 35})
RETURN p1, p2
```

### 5.3 Create a Node with a Label

```cypher
CREATE (n:Employee {name: "Diana", role: "Developer"})
RETURN n
```

### 5.4 Create a Node with Multiple Labels

```cypher
CREATE (n:Person:Manager {name: "Eve", department: "Sales"})
RETURN n
```

### 5.5 Create a Node with Properties

```cypher
CREATE (n:City {name: "Paris", population: 2148327})
RETURN n
```

### 5.6 Returning the Created Node

```cypher
CREATE (n:Book {title: "1984", author: "George Orwell"})
RETURN n
```

## 6. Working with Neo4j in Code

### Neo4j Drivers and REST API

- **Neo4j Drivers**: Official drivers for Python, Java, JavaScript, etc., to send Cypher queries and manage database connections.
- **REST API**: Provides programmatic access to Neo4j for custom integrations.

### 6.1 Example: Movie Recommendation System

Imagine a movie recommendation system using Neo4j and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

- **Nodes**: Users, Movies, Genres, Actors, Directors.
- **Relationships**: `WATCHED`, `ACTED_IN`, `DIRECTED`, `SIMILAR_TO`.

#### Process

1. Import movie data with actors, directors, and genres.
2. Use RAG to process reviews, extract entities (actors, directors), and create relationships with movies based on co-occurrence.
3. Develop Cypher queries to find users who watched similar movies based on genre, actors, or directors.

#### Code Snippet (Python with Neo4j Driver)

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))
session = driver.session()

# Use Cypher queries with RAG insights
query = """
MATCH (user:User)-[:WATCHED]->(movie:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(actor:Actor)
WHERE user.id = {user_id}
WITH user, movie, collect(actor) AS actors
MATCH (movie2:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(actor2:Actor)
WHERE movie2 <> movie AND actor2 IN actors
RETURN movie2
"""

results = session.run(query, user_id=123)
session.close()

# Process results and recommend movies
```
