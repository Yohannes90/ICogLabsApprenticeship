# Task 8: Refactored Initialization Logic for Seamless Model Switching & Bug Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the work completed in **Task 8**, which focuses on refactoring the initialization logic to support seamless model switching for the agent to work with gemini and implementing bug fixes based on feedback from the pull request related to **Task 7: Integrating Dynamic Embedding Model Support (OpenAI/Gemini)** into the existing **Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system.

## Key Enhancements and Fixes
- **Seamless Model Switching:** Refactored initialization logic to enable smooth transitions between different model configurations. This includes reinitializing the Gemini model with the configured `model_name`, allowing the agent to utilize compatible Gemini model variants (e.g., "gemini-1.5-pro" or "gemini-1.5-flash").

- **Model Reinitialization Support:** Introduced the `reinitialize_model` method to the `GeminiModel` class, enabling efficient reinitialization with new model names and improving system flexibility.

- **Vector Size Configuration Fix:** Addressed a bug related to vector size determination. Updated the logic from:
  ```python
  vector_size = 768 if isinstance(self.llm, GeminiModel) else 1536
  ```
  to:
  ```python
  vector_size = 768 if self.llm.__class__.__name__ == "GeminiModel" else 1536
  ```
  This change ensures more robust model type checking and enhances compatibility across different environments.
